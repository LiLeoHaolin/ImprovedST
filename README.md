## Folders

### 1-Data Generation

In this folder, we summarize the computing codes for generating competing risks data following an additive subdistribution hazards model in case-cohort studies. The names of the code and the corresponding simulation scenarios in the paper are as follows,
(simulated data structure)

* *data_generation_1.r* - tree-based effect, 50% event rate.
* *data_generation_2.r* - tree-based effect, 80% event rate.
* *data_generation_3.r* - tree-based effect, 90% event rate.
* *data_generation_4.r* - linear covariate effect, 50% event rate.
* *data_generation_5.r* - linear covariate effect, 80% event rate.
* *data_generation_6.r* - linear covariate effect, 90% event rate.
* *data_generation_7.r* - nonlinear covariate effect, 50% event rate.
* *data_generation_8.r* - nonlinear covariate effect, 80% event rate.
* *data_generation_9.r* - nonlinear covariate effect, 90% event rate.

### 2-Analysis

In this folder, we summarize the computing codes analyzing competing risks data from case-cohort studies using the proposed method. The names and descriptions of the files are as follows,
(input data structure, output)

* *analysis_1.r* - tree-based effect, 50% event rate.
* *analysis_2.r* - tree-based effect, 80% event rate.
* *data_generation_1.r* - tree-based effect, 90% event rate.
* *data_generation_1.r* - linear covariate effect, 50% event rate.
* *data_generation_1.r* - linear covariate effect, 80% event rate.
* *data_generation_1.r* - linear covariate effect, 90% event rate.
* *data_generation_1.r* - nonlinear covariate effect, 50% event rate.
* *data_generation_1.r* - nonlinear covariate effect, 80% event rate.
* *data_generation_1.r* - nonlinear covariate effect, 90% event rate.
